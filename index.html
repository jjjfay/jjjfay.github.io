Project Description</h1>
<p>For our project, we will be controlling a robotic gripping device with a pressure sensor and myoelectric sensors. The robotic hand will be able to rotate about its central axis, controlled by one myoelectric sensor, and open and close, controlled by the second myoelectric sensor. The pressure sensor will be attached to the thumb of the gripping device and will make sure the grip force stays within a desired threshold. This project is centered around a prosthetic hand device donated to the Empower club. This device was created by a biomedical company called Ottobock and features a three fingered mechanical hand controlled by a DC motor with an encoder.</p>
<p>The myoelectric sensors was purchased from sparkfun. The MyoWare 2.0 Muscle Sensor was selected because it was created for the specific purpose of reading electric signals from muscle movements. Thus, it features several output types for easy interpretation of the already filtered signal. Also, this sensor requires a minimum supply of 3.3 volts, which can be easily supplied by the microcontroller.</p>
<p>The pressure sensor we selected is a simple and cost-effective part from amazon. It is a thin film sensor that will easily stick onto the thumb of our gripping device. The sensor only has two wire connections. One wire is the input, which will be supplied and set to 1V with the use of a resistor. The second wire is the output, which will be an input to one of the ADCâ€™s on the microcontroller.</p>
<p>The DC motor we selected is also a simple and cost-effective part. It is a 12V DC motor with an encoder with a top speed of 100 RPM. A convenient feature of this motor is the shaft output is perpendicular to the body of the motor allowing for easy attachment to our design. The motor requires a 3.3-5V power supply.</p>
<p>Overall, our design meets all the rules and requirements of the project. We have two actuators, and two unique sensors in addition to the encoders on each motor. All our hardware was purchased, or 3D printed. Our design is safe for users and bystanders as it will be a mainly stationary device that rotates and moves within a confined area as it will be attached to a steady base. We used the remote controller as a emergency shutoff switch for our design. </p>
