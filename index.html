Project Description</h1>
<p>Our project is centered around the control of an electromechanically actuated prosthetic hand manufactured by Australian orthopedic and prosthetic design company Ottobock donated to the EMPOWER Student Association. The goal is to create a proof-of-concept control system to actuate the prosthetic hand via myoelectric sensor input. Our design implements two myoelectric sensors, two brushed DC motors, and one rotary encoder. The hand can rotate about its central axis and open/close, controlled by two myoelectric sensors. The design also includes an emergency stop via radio transmitter for safety purposes. The selected MCU was the STM32L476RGT6 due to our familiarity with this chip from previous quarters and its number of ADC’s and timer channels. The final product of this project did not meet all the goals outlined for the project due to issues with the PCB and hardware. During testing, our custom PCB’s power rail broke down, so a NUCLEO development board was used. Additionally, the myoelectric sensors stopped functioning correctly during testing and no longer produced a consistently readable output. Thus, instead of using muscle actuation to move the motors, the gain on the sensors were manually increased and decreased by hand to force the expected output to be interpreted by our program. Lastly, the motor on the prosthetic hand initially selected to use for this project was nonfunctional, so an alternative hand without an encoder was used, affecting the controllability of the hand movement. An image of the final design is shown below.</p>

<p>The pressure sensor we selected is a simple and cost-effective part from amazon. It is a thin film sensor that will easily stick onto the thumb of our gripping device. The sensor only has two wire connections. One wire is the input, which will be supplied and set to 1V with the use of a resistor. The second wire is the output, which will be an input to one of the ADC’s on the microcontroller.</p>
<p>The DC motor we selected is also a simple and cost-effective part. It is a 12V DC motor with an encoder with a top speed of 100 RPM. A convenient feature of this motor is the shaft output is perpendicular to the body of the motor allowing for easy attachment to our design. The motor requires a 3.3-5V power supply.</p>
<p>Overall, our design meets all the rules and requirements of the project. We have two actuators, and two unique sensors including the spin motor encoder and the myo electric sensors. All our hardware was purchased, or 3D printed.Our design is safe for users and bystanders as it will be a mainly stationary device that rotates and moves within a confined area as it will be attached to a steady base. We used the remote controller as a emergency shut-off switch for our design. </p>
